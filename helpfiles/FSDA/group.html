<h1>The forward search group</h1>
The core of the Forward Search group comes both from the the members of the division 
of statistics and computing of the University of Parma and the Department of Statistics 
of the London School of Economics (from now on ParmaLSE) made up of Anthony 
Atkinson (LSE), Marco Riani and Andrea Cerioli (Parma) . This has resulted in the 
publication of two books with Springer-Verlag New York (Atkinson and Riani, 2000; 
Atkinson Riani and Cerioli, 2004) and about 15 papers in prestigious international 
journals.
<p>The last 15 years of joint research of people from ParmaLSE can be summarized 
as follows: </p>
<p>1994-2002. Introduction of the new approach. At that time we were completely 
unaware of many of the potentialities of the new approach and we did not think of it as 
a new philosophy. The emphasis was as a new technique of exploratory data analysis 
in linear and nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. In the case of 
a single population and contaminated data, the new approach revealed itself 
as a powerful tool for detecting the presence of outliers, both individual and grouped, 
and to evaluate their effect on the results of traditional analyses (Riani and 
Atkinson, 2000). </p>
<p>2002-2004. Extension of this technique to the analysis of multivariate data based 
on a combination of statistical modelling and graphical diagnostics.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2005-2007. In this period we began to introduce the Forward Search not only as 
an exploratory tool but also for inferential purposes and we have developed a theory 
for the construction of robust confidence bands for the curves which are monitored 
along the search. </p>
<p>From 2008. In recent times the team has oriented its activities as follows.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recently some members of the ParmaLSE team laid the foundation for the automatic 
application of the procedure in multivariate analysis (Riani et al. 2009). Clearly, 
the automation of the procedure is necessary in concrete applications where the 
Forward Search has to be repeated many times. One of the objectives of the team 
is to extend this automated procedure to multiple regression or, more generally, 
to the analysis of complex data. The first step in this direction can be found in 
Riani et al. (2008). </li>
	<li>In 2008 ParmaLSE initiated a close collaboration with the European Commission&#39;s 
Joint Research Centre in order to understand how the new philosophy could be extended 
to the data of international trade and applied to related antifraud problems. The 
persons involved in this project at the JRC were Domenico Perrotta, Francesca Torti 
(now working for the University of Parma), Vytis Kopustinskas and the head of the 
group, Spyros Arsenis. The FSDA toolbox is one of the main outcomes of this collaboration. 
There is a manifest intention for the long term consolidation of our current collaboration.
	</li>
	<li>In 2009 fruitful contacts have been established between the ParmaLSE team and 
the University of Rome La Sapienza (Pierluigi Conti and Alessio Farcomeni) 
in view of grounding the Forward Search in the theory of empirical processes. The 
objective is to find the limiting trajectories to which the curves monitored in 
the Forward Search might converge. </li>
	<li>The number of PhD students who are attracted by the new philosophy is increasing. 
We mention two whose studies are in progress in the Parma team, in topics such as 
	&quot;The forward search in Bayesian statistics (Aldo Corbellini)&quot; and &quot;Robust 
	classification and mixtures (Gianluca Morelli)&quot;. The intention to extend the cooperation 
with young researchers is also in the plans of the JRC and the wider Forward Search 
team. Other members of ParmaLSE (Grossi and Laurini, 2009) are working on the extension 
of the new philosophy to the analysis of correlated observations and more specifically 
to the context of extreme value theory. Unfortunately the different contributions 
have been proposed without a unifying scheme and appropriate coordination. The team 
has become aware that this is a wider problem and that more critical mass is necessary 
to reach a wider popularity among data analysts. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are convinced that the lack of good statistical software is a main factor 
limiting the diffusion of the new philosophy and we hope that the FSDA toolbox will 
fill the gap. Another effort in this direction was made in 2008 by a JRC grantholder, 
Tomas Demcenko, who implemented SAS IML macros for the Forward Search in regression. 
Previously, excellent implementations in Splus and R were developed by Dr. Konis 
for the analysis of multivariate data (e.g. the Rfwdmd software downloadable from 
the CRAN site). Unfortunately, lack of resources prevented the maintenance of such 
implementations. </p>
<p>It is worthwhile to mention other people who share the same philosophy, who have 
been in contact from time to time with the “ParmaLSE team” and who have already 
given important theoretical and applied contributions to the forward search literature. 
For example, Fabio Crosilla of the University of Udine has extended the forward 
routines to data on photogrammetry. This extension has considerably improved the 
classification of spatial objects (Crosilla et al., 2007). Nadia Solaro is currently 
working to extend this new philosophy to multilevel models (Solaro and Pagani, 2009). 
Daniela Calò has investigated the use of forward search routines for finding groups 
of homogeneous observations in the context of robust cluster analysis (Calò, 2008). 
Silvia Salini has recently worked on robust extensions of calibration models using 
forward search tools (Salini, 2006). Matilde Bini has used the forward search to 
develop robust transformations in percentage data (Bini and Bertaccini, 2007) while 
Bruno Bertaccini, together with Roberta Varriale, has extended the new philosophy 
to the robust analysis of variance (Bertaccini and Varriale, 2007). </p>
<p>The forward search philosophy of data analysis presents strong connection with 
other approaches of robust statistics. For example an iterative procedure, closely 
related to the forward search, is considered in García-Escudero and Gordaliza (2007) 
that may be applied in robust heterogeneous clustering problems. We also require 
interaction with researchers who use approaches based on dynamic models which show 
strong points of contact with our philosophy (A. Monti). For example, the group 
intends to investigate the use of the robust adaptive estimates proposed in Di Ciccio 
and Monti (2004, 2008) and their integration into our philosophy of data analysis. 
Another contact point with the robust literature is linked to weighted likelihood 
(Markatou, Basu and Lindsay, 1998) and minimum distance methods, where outliers and 
inliers are defined according to a probabilistic scale. This scale is based on the 
comparison between the empirical distribution function and that of the assumed model. 
The advantages of using definitions of outliers and inliers based on a probabilistic 
scale, rather than on a geometric one, are several. Here we just mention direct 
applicability in a wide set of models including circular data (Agostinelli, 2007), 
mixture models (Markatou, 2000) and generalized linear models (Agostinelli and Al-quallaf, 
2009). </p>
<p>In summary, it is true to say that the growth of the Forward Search method into 
a philosophy and practical approach of data analysis is largely due to the initiative 
and leadership of Anthony Atkinson, Marco Riani and Andrea Cerioli who, when the 
method was introduced, had the capacity to move the research well beyond the then 
understood scientific boundaries. However, we also believe that the success of this 
philosophy of data analysis relies on a wider combination of circumstances and people, 
which comprises these ingredients: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Cultivate and create space for fresh ideas. Young 
researchers at doctoral and post-doctoral level will be always more than welcome. 
	New mathematical results providing theoretical underpinnings to the observed excellent 
performance of our methodology of data analysis (Stochastic processes group).</li>
	<li>A stable 
practical laboratory for the assessment of our theoretical foundations, providing 
a considerable number of applications to real data affected by different sources 
of heterogeneity (JRC group). We are firmly convinced that only a close interaction 
between theoretical understanding and practical exploration can ensure advancement 
towards our objectives. </li>
	<li>Professionally written open source software. A Software 
group should be created and extended beyond the current FSDA developers. </li>
	<li>Spread 
the new methodology to different fields of application and at the same time extend 
the procedure theoretically and empirically to the new problems which arise from 
the different contexts (Statistics and engineering group).</li>
	<li>Interact with scientists 
from the robust statistics community in order to understand how some recent proposals 
(i.e. those based on robust adaptive estimators and the weighted likelihood approach) 
can be integrated into our new philosophy of data analysis (Robust statistics group).</li>
