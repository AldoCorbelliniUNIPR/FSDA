<h1>The forward search group</h1>
The core of the Forward Search group comes both from the the members of the
division of statistics and computing of the University of Parma and the
Department of Statistics of the London School of Economics (from now on
ParmaLSE) made up of Anthony Atkinson (LSE), Marco Riani and Andrea Cerioli
(Parma) . This has resulted in the publication of two books with
Springer-Verlag New York (Atkinson and Riani, 2000; Atkinson Riani and Cerioli,
2004) and many papers in prestigious international journals. The last 15 years
of joint research of people from ParmaLSE can be summarized as follows: 

<p><strong>1994-2002.</strong> Introduction of the new approach. At that time
we were completely unaware of many of the potentialities of the new approach
and we did not think of it as a new philosophy. The emphasis was as a new
technique of exploratory data analysis in linear and nonlinear regression and
generalized linear models. In the case of a single population and contaminated
data, the new approach revealed itself as a powerful tool for detecting the
presence of outliers, both individual and grouped, and to evaluate their effect
on the results of traditional analyses (Riani and Atkinson, 2000). </p>

<p><strong>2002-2004.</strong> Extension of this technique to the analysis of
multivariate data based on a combination of statistical modelling and graphical
diagnostics.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>2005-2008. </strong> In this period we began to introduce the Forward
Search not only as an exploratory tool but also for inferential purposes and we
have developed a theory for the construction of robust confidence bands for the
curves which are monitored along the search. This work laid to the foundation for the automatic
application of the procedure in multivariate analysis (Riani et al.
2009). Clearly, the automation of the procedure is necessary in
concrete applications where the Forward Search has to be repeated many
times. One of the objectives of the team is to extend this automated
procedure to multiple regression or, more generally, to the analysis of
complex data. The first step in this direction can be found in Riani et
al. (2008).</p>
<p><strong>2005. </strong>Well before the FSDA toolbox, an
implementation of the Forward Search was done in Splus and R by Dr.
Konis for the analysis of multivariate data (e.g. the Rfwdmd software
downloadable from the CRAN site). Unfortunately, lack of resources
prevented the maintenance of such implementations but, almost ten years
later, Luca Scrucca revitalized the package ‘forward’.<br />
 </p>




<p><strong>2008 on.&nbsp;</strong> The need to apply routinely the
Forward Search and robust methods to huge amounts of international
trade data and related antifraud problems encouraged a new
collaboration between the ParmaLSE team and the European Commission's
Joint Research Centre.The persons originally involved in this project at the JRC were
Domenico Perrotta, Francesca Torti (working for several years also for
the University of Parma), Vytis Kopustinskas and the head of the group,
Spyros Arsenis. The joint activities of the two teams progressed till today with always-new stimuli and challenging problems.&nbsp; The FSDA toolbox is one of the main outcomes of this collaboration.  <br />
</p>
<p>The ParmaLSE - JRC teams created in the last years lot of synergies
with new research groups, extending considerably the network of
scientists interested in (robust) solutions to anti-fraud problems and
in the Forward Search as an original approach for data analysis. With
apologies for possible unvoluntaries omissions, we mention here some
milestones and groups:<strong></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2009. </strong>Fruitful contacts were established with the University of Rome La Sapienza (Pierluigi Conti and Alessio
    Farcomeni) in view of grounding the Forward Search in the theory of
    empirical processes. The objective is to find the limiting trajectories to
    which the curves monitored in the Forward Search might converge.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2009. </strong>Collaboration with the University of Verona (Grossi and Laurini, 2009) produced extensions of the new
    philosophy to the analysis of correlated observations and more specifically
    to the context of extreme value theory.</p>

<strong />


<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2010. </strong>New studies on the Forward Search philosophy were initiated
    by PhD students (now integrated in the Parma team) in topics such as "The forward search in Bayesian statistics (Aldo
    Corbellini)" and "Robust classification and mixtures (Gianluca Morelli)". <br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2011. </strong>Fruitful
collaboration started with the robust clustering group of the
University of Valladolid (Carlos Matran, Alfonso Gordaliza, Agustín
Mayo-Iscar, Carlos Matrán, Luis Angel García-Escudero), with regular
meetings organised in Ispra, Parma and Valladolid. The link between the
Valladolid group was naturally established, because of the close
relation between their trimming approach (considered e.g. in
García-Escudero and
Gordaliza, 2007) and the Forward Search. Relevant outcomes of the
collaboration include methodological studies (e.g. on the determination
of the number of groups in TCLUST), applications of TCLUST and RLGA in
antifraud,&nbsp; and new FSDA functions for trimmed based clustering
methods, including tools for the generation of simulated clustering
data based on prespecified level of overlap (MixSim). The forward
search philosophy of data analysis presents strong connection
with other approaches of robust statistics. <br />
</p>
<strong />
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2013-2014. </strong>This may
become an important milestone, because we are convinced that the lack
of good statistical software is a main factor limiting the diffusion of
the new philosophy and robust statistics in general. The milestone is
about the porting of the main FSDA Forward Search functions to SAS IML
and SAS IML Studio. The work, initiated in 2008 by the JRC trainee
Tomas Demcenko, was revitalized and finalized in the JRC by Francesca
Torti in collaboration with staff from SAS: Koen Knapen and Jos
Polfliet. With the porting, now the Forward Search can be run in the
SAS platform for both inferential and exploratory data analysis
purposes, including several of the interactive and dynamic plotting
features that characterize FSDA.<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2013-2014. </strong>A second
factor potentially limiting the diffusion of the new philosophy was the
lack of sound asymptotic theory for the Forward Search monitoring
process. Johansen and Nielsen (2013, 2014), starting from several
meetings held with the ParmaLSE team, developed respectively pointwise
and simultaneous confidence bands for estimators and forward residuals.
Nielsen also implemented the undelying asymptotic theory in&nbsp; the `ForwardSearch' R package. 
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>It is worthwhile to mention other people who share the same philosophy, who
have been in contact from time to time with the “ParmaLSE team” and who
have already given important theoretical and applied contributions to the
forward search literature. For example, Fabio Crosilla of the University of
Udine has extended the forward routines to data on photogrammetry. This
extension has considerably improved the classification of spatial objects
(Crosilla et al., 2007). Nadia Solaro is currently working to extend this new
philosophy to multilevel models (Solaro and Pagani, 2009). Daniela Calò has
investigated the use of forward search routines for finding groups of
homogeneous observations in the context of robust cluster analysis (Calò,
2008). Silvia Salini has recently worked on robust extensions of calibration
models using forward search tools (Salini, 2006). Matilde Bini has used the
forward search to develop robust transformations in percentage data (Bini and
Bertaccini, 2007) while Bruno Bertaccini, together with Roberta Varriale, has
extended the new philosophy to the robust analysis of variance (Bertaccini and
Varriale, 2007). </p>

<p>We also advise interaction with researchers who use approaches based
on dynamic models which show strong points of contact with our philosophy (A.
Monti). For example, the group intends to investigate the use of the robust
adaptive estimates proposed in Di Ciccio and Monti (2004, 2008) and their
integration into our philosophy of data analysis. Another contact point with
the robust literature is linked to weighted likelihood (Markatou, Basu and
Lindsay, 1998) and minimum distance methods, where outliers and inliers are
defined according to a probabilistic scale. This scale is based on the
comparison between the empirical distribution function and that of the assumed
model. The advantages of using definitions of outliers and inliers based on a
probabilistic scale, rather than on a geometric one, are several. Here we just
mention direct applicability in a wide set of models including circular data
(Agostinelli, 2007), mixture models (Markatou, 2000) and generalized linear
models (Agostinelli and Al-quallaf, 2009). </p>

<p>In summary, it is true to say that the growth of the Forward Search method
into a philosophy and practical approach of data analysis is largely due to the
initiative and leadership of Anthony Atkinson, Marco Riani and Andrea Cerioli
who, when the method was introduced, had the capacity to move the research well
beyond the then understood scientific boundaries. However, we also believe that
the success of this philosophy of data analysis relies on a wider combination
of circumstances and people, which comprises these ingredients: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Cultivate and create space for fresh ideas. Young researchers at doctoral
    and post-doctoral level will be always more than welcome. New mathematical
    results providing theoretical underpinnings to the observed excellent
    performance of our methodology of data analysis (Stochastic processes
    group).</li>
  <li>A stable practical laboratory for the assessment of our theoretical
    foundations, providing a considerable number of applications to real data
    affected by different sources of heterogeneity (JRC group). We are firmly
    convinced that only a close interaction between theoretical understanding
    and practical exploration can ensure advancement towards our objectives.
  </li>
  <li>Professionally written open source software. A Software group should be
    created and extended beyond the current FSDA developers. </li>
  <li>Spread the new methodology to different fields of application and at the
    same time extend the procedure theoretically and empirically to the new
    problems which arise from the different contexts (Statistics and
    engineering group).</li>
  <li>Interact with scientists from the robust statistics community in order to
    understand how some recent proposals (i.e. those based on robust adaptive
    estimators and the weighted likelihood approach) can be integrated into our
    new philosophy of data analysis (Robust statistics group).</li>
