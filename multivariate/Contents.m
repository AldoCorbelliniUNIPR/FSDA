%   FSM       - gives an automatic outlier detection procedure in mult. analysis
%   FSMeda    - FSMeda performs forward search in multivariate analysis with exploratory data analysis purposes
%   FSMenvmmd - FSMenvmmd computes the theoretical envelopes of Minimum MD outside subset during the search
%   FSMmmd    - FSMmmd monitors minMD
%   unibiv    - unibiv has the purpose of detecting univariate and bivariate outliers
%   FSMfan    - FSMfan computes confirmatory lrt of a suggested transformation
%   FSMtra    - FSMtra computes MLE of transformation parameters.
%   FSMinvmmd - FSMinvmmd converts values of minimum Mahalanobis distance into confidence levels
%   FSMbbm     - FSMbbm gives the units belonging to subset at step(s) msel of the forward search
%   FSMmmdeasy - FSMmmdeasy is exactly equal to minMD but much less efficient.
